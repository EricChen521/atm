Installation
============

atm can be installed with `conda <https://conda.io>`__.

We suggest using `mamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`__, an optimized Conda
package solver, for installing packages at Drailab. Install mamba with
``conda install -n base mamba``.

We use a private Conda registry to store the proprietary software that we developed.
For our internal installation procedure, please refer to
`our devdocs <https://drailab.gitlab.io/devdocs/latest/installation.html#internal-procedure>`__.
